# Project Decoder Ring
A JavaScript project with 3 different functions that a user can use to encode and decode messages.

## Features
### Caesar Shift
When the user enters a string of letters, the letters will shift to either the left or right of the alphabet.
The user enters a string of letters, a number to shift, and whether or not to shift forwards or backward.

### Polybius Square
When the user enters a string of letters, a string of numbers is returned, or vice versa.
Each letter is set to a specific number shown in the Polybius square.

### Substitution cypher
Users can either encode or decode a message, using a substitute alphabet.
The user enters 3 inputs. The first is a message, the second a substitute alphabet, 
and finally whether to encode or decode the message.

## Technology
### Built with vanilla JavaScript, including:
- Higher-order functions
- Regular expressions
- Destructuring

## Discoveries
Figured out what a regular expression is, and used it to complete my goals. Got better acquainted with 
destructuring and higher-order functions.

## Future Goals
Refactor the code to make it more concise and use more techniques that I have learned since completing the project.
