# Project Decoder Ring
### Decoder ring project that I did through Thinkful

## Caesar Shift
When user enters a string of letters, the letters will shift to either the left or right of the alphabet.
User enters a string of letters, a number to shift, and whether or not to shift forwards or backwards.

## Polybius Square
When user enters a string of letters, a string of numbers is returned, or vice versa.
Each letter is set to a specific number shown in the polybius square.

## Substitution cypher
User can either encode or decode a message, using a substitute alphabet.
User enters 3 inputs. The first is a message, the second a substitute alphabet, 
and finally whether to encode or decode the message.
